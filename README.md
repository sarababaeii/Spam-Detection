# Persian Spam Email Detector

An NLP project for detecting spam emails in Persian, using a k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) classifier.

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and probabilistic similarity measures to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) Persian emails.
It implements a k-Nearest Neighbours classifier from scratch, trains and evaluates the model using features derived from text similarity metrics, and compares the performance of cosine similarity and TF-IDF weighting.
The model’s effectiveness is assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Dataset

The training and testing data are available at: [Spam Filtering For Persian (GitHub)](https://github.com/omidrohanian/Spam-Filtering-For-Persian/tree/master/emails).
